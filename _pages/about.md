I was a PhD student with the Machine Learning and Data Science Research (MLDS) group at the State University of New York at Buffalo, working under Dr Varun Chandola. I have completed my Masters at UB as well with a perfect GPA and subsequently decided to pursue a PhD degree.

Broadly, my area of research is in large scale Machine Learning and Data Mining. Specifically my research focuses on designing, analyzing and implementing novel Machine Learning algorithms that take advantage of modern hardware to enable learning and mining of massive graphs and data sets.
