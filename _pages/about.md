I am currently a Research Scientist with Criteo Research. Broadly my work encompasses applying different Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Nonlinear Optimization techniques to solve related problems. I have recently begun exploring how to design deep neural nets (specifically, LSTMs, RNNs and CNNs) for text/imaging applications. Please feel free to contact me at suchismi [at] buffalo.edu :)

I was a PhD student with the [Machine Learning and Data Science Research (MLDS) group](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/ubds/) at the [State University of New York at Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu), working under [Varun Chandola](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~chandola). I have completed my Masters at [UB](http://www.buffalo.edu) as well with a perfect GPA and subsequently decided to pursue a PhD degree.

Broadly, my area of research is in large scale Machine Learning and Data Mining. Specifically my research focuses on designing, analyzing and implementing novel Machine Learning algorithms that take advantage of modern hardware to enable learning and mining of massive graphs and data sets.
