Computing graph similarity is an important task in many graphrelated applications such as retrieval in graph databases or graph clustering. While numerous measures have been proposed to capture the similarity between a pair of graphs, Graph Edit Distance (GED) and Maximum Common Subgraphs (MCS) are the two widely
used measures in practice. GED and MCS are domain-agnostic measures of structural similarity between the graphs, and define the similarity as a function of pairwise alignment of different entities in the two graphs such as nodes, edges, and subgraphs. GED and MCS have important practical applications because the explicit explainability of the similarity score provides transparency and justification, as well as additional informative inductive knowledge toward decision making in downstream analysis. However, their
exact computations are known to be NP-hard. While recently proposed neural-network based approximations have been shown to accurately compute these similarity scores, they have limited ability in providing comprehensive explanations when compared to classical combinatorial algorithms. This paper deals with efficiently approximating these domain-agnostic similarity measures through neural networks where the alignments, i.e., explanations similar to those of classical intractable methods can be learned simultaneously. More precisely, we propose a learning-based graph-similarity method, based on a novel optimal assignment formulation. We formulate the similarity between a pair of graphs as the minimal
“transformation” cost from one graph to another in the learnable, node-embedding space. We show that, if node embedding is able to capture its neighborhood context closely, our proposed similarity function closely approximates both the alignment and the similarity score of classical methods for domain-agnostic measures such as GED. Furthermore, we also propose an efficient differentiable computation of our proposed objective for model training. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 50%-100% reduction in the Mean Squared Error for the graph similarity approximation task and up to 20% improvement in the retrieval evaluation metrics for the graph retrieval task.
